## Bugs? Ideas?

You can submit bugs on Github.
You can submit ideas too, but I do not guarantee that I will add any of them.

I started this project to have a RSS reader that fits _my_ needs. If CLX-RSS doesnâ€™t fit yours, I suggest you learn to code, fork this project and adapt it to make it do what _you_ want.
